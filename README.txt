Snake Game:
press 's' to start the game
press 'a' to start moving
I added two buttons:
- camera view - change to camera from the static view to the
snake point of view and back

- Auto Mode - change the game mode to auto and back - the snake can
move by himself or by the arrows.
 
Every target is worth 1 Point, every level there is one moving target
that worth 2 Points.

The Points and the Levels are always display on the screen.
When the snake finish to eat all the targets on the screen
he is reaching a new level.

the background is skybox cubemap.
